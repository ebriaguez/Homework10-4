    Arrays
-Arrays are building blocks to data structures that java has to offer
-you can think of an array as a bucket or lists of buckets where you define a fixed size
-the index starts at 0
-arrays are fast for data retrieval
-compact for memory usage if size is known
-delete operation is hard
-building blocks for 2D-arrays

2D Arrays
-Tic-tac-toe board
-good for applications that make usage of a grid
-row 1 would start at 0,0
-row 2 would be 1,0
-column 1 would start at 0,0
-column 2 would be 0,1

Lists and Array Lists
-Collections interface is a collections of elements
-Lists have more information on how to preform certain actions with your collection or list
-various implementations
-a list is backed by an array
-List in an interface that extends collection

Stack
-Represents a last-in-first out stack of objects'
-it extends Vector with 5 operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack
-like a pack of pringles, that last chip to go in, is the first one to come out
-.push is for adding an element to the stack, .pop is for removing the element at the top of the stack
 .peek is for seeing what's at the top of the stack without removing and .empty checks if the stack is empty.
